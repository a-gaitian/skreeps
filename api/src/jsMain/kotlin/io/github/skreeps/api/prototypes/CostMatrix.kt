/**
 * Container for custom navigation cost data. By default [PathFinder] will only consider terrain data
 * (plain, swamp, wall) â€” if you need to route around obstacles such as buildings or creeps you must
 * put them into a [CostMatrix]. Generally you will create your [CostMatrix] from within `roomCallback`.
 * If a non-0 value is found in a room's CostMatrix then that value will be used instead of the
 * default terrain cost. You should avoid using large values in your CostMatrix and terrain cost
 * flags. For example, running [PathFinder.search] with `{ plainCost: 1, swampCost: 5 }` is faster than
 * running it with `{plainCost: 2, swampCost: 10 }` even though your paths will be the same
 *
 * @constructor Creates a new CostMatrix containing 0's for all positions
